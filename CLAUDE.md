## Development Philosophy

- **Simplicity**: Write simple, straightforward code
- **Readability**: Make code easy to understand
- **Performance**: Consider performance without sacrificing readability
- **Maintainability**: Write code that's easy to update
- **Testability**: Ensure code is testable
- **Reusability**: Create reusable components and functions
- **Less Code = Less Debt**: Minimize code footprint

## Coding Best Practices

- **Early Returns**: Use to avoid nested conditions
- **Descriptive Names**: Use clear variable/function names (prefix handlers with "handle")
- **Constants Over Functions**: Use constants where possible
- **DRY Code**: Don't repeat yourself
- **Functional Style**: Prefer functional, immutable approaches when not verbose
- **Minimal Changes**: Only modify code related to the task at hand
- **Function Ordering**: Define composing functions before their components
- **TODO Comments**: Mark issues in existing code with "TODO:" prefix
- **Simplicity**: Prioritize simplicity and readability over clever solutions
- **Build Iteratively** Start with minimal functionality and verify it works before adding complexity
- **Run Tests**: Test your code frequently with realistic inputs and validate outputs
- **Build Test Environments**: Create testing environments for components that are difficult to validate directly
- **Functional Code**: Use functional and stateless approaches where they improve clarity
- **Clean logic**: Keep core logic clean and push implementation details to the edges
- **File Organsiation**: Balance file organization with simplicity - use an appropriate number of files for the project scale


When modifying or generating UI for this project, prioritize a polished, intentional product feel — NOT "AI demo UI".  
The interface should feel like a thoughtfully designed developer tool, not a template.

## ✨ Core Design Principles
- **Calm, professional, minimal**
- **Readable > flashy**
- **Hierarchy over clutter**
- **Subtle motion & spacing > heavy decoration**
- **Consistency across screens**

The UI should feel closer to:
- Linear
- Notion
- Streamlit gallery *production tools*
NOT:
- HuggingFace demo
- Midjourney playground
- “AI toy UI”

NO EMOJIS!!


# Ask Clarifying Questions When Needed

- When in plan mode ALWAYS ask clarifying questions
- When in agent mode, ask clarifiying questions when requirements are not clear.
